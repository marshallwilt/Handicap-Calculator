# Handicap-Calculator
This program calculates a golfer’s Handicap Index. A golf handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer’s ability, and allows golfers of differing skill levels to compete against one another. The Handicap Index represents the number of strokes above (or below) par that a player is expected to shoot in a typical round.
The Handicap Index takes many factors into account: 1) the number
of rounds a player has scores from, 2) the Course Rating (how hard the course played is for a
person with a +0.0 handicap), 3) the Slope Rating (how much harder the course is for people
with higher handicaps), and 4) the weather conditions during the round.
