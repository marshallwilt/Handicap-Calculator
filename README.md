# Handicap-Calculator
This program calculates a golfer’s Handicap Index. A golf handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer’s ability, and allows golfers of differing skill levels to compete against one another. The Handicap Index represents the number of strokes above (or below) par that a player is expected to shoot in a typical round.
